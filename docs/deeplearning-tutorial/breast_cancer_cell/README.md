## About Dataset

In this dataset, there are 58 H&E stained histopathology images used in breast cancer cell detection with associated ground truth data available. Routine histology uses the stain combination of hematoxylin and eosin, commonly referred to as H&E. These images are stained since most cells are essentially transparent, with little or no intrinsic pigment. Certain special stains, which bind selectively to particular components, are be used to identify biological structures such as cells. In those images, the challenging problem is cell segmentation for subsequent classification in benign and malignant cells.
