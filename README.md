## ðŸ§¬ Research Focus
Computational biology | Metagenomics | Machine learning | Data science

I develop reproducible R/Python pipelines for microbiome research, focusing on:
- Data analysis workflows for taxonomic, functional, and diversity profiling (16S & shotgun metagenomics)
- Statistical modeling and publication-quality visualizations
- HPC/SLURM workflows for large-scale computational biology
